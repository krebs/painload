  which node or build


//krebscode/painload/retiolum/scripts/tinc_setup/install.sh or something
  should be called by painload/infest
  and should be enterprise enough to be infested multiple times
  -- please see how infest/bin/make-patch is generating a patch, that gets
     applied by Makefile

//krebscode/painload/noise
  - should be infested host-specifically
    - i.e. to start automatically at KREBS

//krebscode/painload/noise
  - NOISE-STREAMS-MODULE
    - should have a module to allow switching of the streams
    - should have a module to allow managing of streams
    - is this mergable with noise/modules/stream [by chris]
      - or can we replace noise/modules/stream

//krebscode/painload/streams
  - should be infested host-specifically
    - i.e. to start automatically at KREBS
    - the last stream should be playbacked
    - should be controlable by noise [see NOISE-STREAM-MODULE]
