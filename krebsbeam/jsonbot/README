JSONBOT is a remote event-driven framework for building bots that talk JSON
to each other over XMPP. 

This distribution provides bots built on this framework for console, IRC,
XMPP and Convore for the shell and WWW and XMPP for the Google Application engine.

JSONBOT is all of the following:

    * a shell console bot
    * a shell IRC bot

    * a shell Convore bot
    * a Web bot running on Google Application Engine
    * a XMPP bot running on Google Application Engine
    * a Google Wave bot running op Google Application Engine
    * the XMPP bots are used to communicate between bots
    * plugin infrastructure to write your own functionality
    * event driven framework by the use of callbacks
